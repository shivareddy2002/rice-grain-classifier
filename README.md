- Clean and interactive **web interface**  
- Lightweight and easy to deploy  
- Real-time predictions using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**  

---

## 📊 Dataset

- Contains images of different rice varieties  
- Each image is preprocessed (resized, normalized, augmented) before training  
- Trained on a **custom-labeled dataset** of rice images

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+** – Core programming language  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – Deep learning model  
- **Streamlit** – Web app interface  
- **FastAPI** – REST API support  
- **OpenCV & PIL** – Image processing  
- **NumPy / Pandas** – Data handling  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Visualizations (optional)  

---

## 🔮 How it Works

1. Upload a rice grain image (JPG/PNG)  
2. The model **preprocesses** and **resizes** the image  
3. Predictions are made across the supported rice varieties  
4. Results are displayed with **confidence scores**  

---

## ✨ Future Enhancements

- Add more rice varieties  
- Deploy on **Hugging Face Spaces**, **AWS**.  
- Mobile-friendly UI  
- Batch prediction for multiple grains at once
